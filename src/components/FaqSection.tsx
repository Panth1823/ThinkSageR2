    question: "How long does it typically take to complete a website project?",
    answer: "Project timelines vary based on complexity, but most websites take 3-6 weeks from kickoff to launch. Simple landing pages may be completed in as little as 2 weeks, while more complex sites with custom functionality can take 8-10 weeks. I'll provide you with a specific timeline during our initial consultation."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide ongoing support after the website launches?",
    answer: "Yes, all projects include a support period after launch (ranging from 1-6 months depending on your package). During this time, I'll address any issues, make minor adjustments, and ensure everything is running smoothly. For ongoing maintenance and updates, I offer affordable monthly maintenance packages."
  },
  {
    question: "Will my website work on mobile devices and tablets?",
    answer: "Absolutely! All websites I build are fully responsive, ensuring they look and function perfectly across all devices - from smartphones to desktop computers. I follow a mobile-first development approach, which means your site will provide an optimal experience regardless of screen size."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure the websites you build will convert visitors to customers?",
    answer: "Conversion is central to my design process. I combine proven UX principles, strategic placement of calls-to-action, clear value propositions, and optimized user flows to guide visitors toward conversion actions. I also implement analytics to track user behavior and make data-driven improvements over time."
  },
  {
    question: "What information do you need from me to get started?",
    answer: "To begin, I'll need your business goals, target audience information, brand assets (logo, colors, etc.), content for the site, and examples of websites you like. Don't worry if you don't have everything readyâ€”I provide a detailed questionnaire and can guide you through the content creation process if needed."
